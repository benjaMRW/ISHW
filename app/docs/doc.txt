SCHOOL BYLAWS
Adopted by the School Board as at April 2025
The essence of good, positive behaviour is RESPECT.
Respect for self, for others and respect for Burnside High School values and bylaws.
Respect is an attitude that begins at home, is reinforced in school, and is applied throughout life.
The school bylaws promote the values of the Burnside ethos.
They state how we are to behave at Burnside High School.
Respect for bylaws is shown by:
▪ living the Burnside values – Be Respectful, Have Pride, Strive for Excellence
▪ considering the wairua, the spirit, that underpins our bylaws when making personal decisions
▪ acknowledging, accepting and following the bylaws in any school setting
▪ realising that different situations and occasions call for different behaviours, and responding
appropriately
Explanation and Procedures
It is a condition of enrolment that students admitted to Burnside High School are bound by
regulations and bylaws as laid down by the School Board. Parents, caregivers, students and staff are
expected to be familiar with these bylaws.
To ensure that classrooms are learning-focused environments for everyone, students will observe
the classroom behaviour expectations displayed in classrooms throughout the school.
Students are subject to school Bylaws and disciplinary procedures at any time, including travelling
to and from school and when they are involved in a Burnside High School activity or in any situation
where they can be identified as a Burnside High School student. A high standard of behaviour and
presentation is expected.

way or for any reason.
b) Show respect for school property, and the property of other students:
⎯ Leave other peoples’ property alone and take care of your own.
Students losing property should in the first instance report to Student
Services. If you find property unattended take it to Student Services − it
is not yours to keep.
1.3 Any behaviour which undermines the safety or well-being of individuals is
unacceptable and should be reported immediately to someone who can help the
student, e.g. a teacher or senior student. All members of the school community are
expected to be supportive of each other at all times.

Burnside High School is possible.
1.6 A student may be stood down or suspended from school where a student’s gross
misconduct or continual disobedience is a harmful or dangerous example to other
students at school; or because of the student’s behaviour, it is likely that the student,

stood down or suspended. Misconduct that may lead to stand down or suspension
includes:
▪ constant defiance or disobedience of instructions or rules

Burnside High School: Academic Authenticity Policy
At Burnside High School, our values of Manaakitanga (Bring respect), Mana (Have pride), and
Rangatiratanga (Seek excellence) guide our commitment to academic integrity.
This Policy requires all student work to be authentic, upholding fairness and validity in assessment.
Assessment is authentic when it affirms the skills, knowledge and competencies acquired by students
and reflects real world contexts.



We expect all evidence of achievement to be a student's own work; academic misconduct,
intentional or not, carries serious consequences.
Understanding Academic Authenticity and Misconduct
Academic authenticity means all assessed work is genuinely the student's own. Academic misconduct
includes cheating, plagiarism, dishonesty, and improper digital tool use, including Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI). Key challenges to authenticity are:
● Plagiarism: Presenting others' work as your own without proper acknowledgment.
● Excessive guidance: Getting too much help from others, compromising your independent
learning.
● Online answers: Using pre-existing solutions from online sources.
● Improper GenAI use: Submitting GenAI-produced content as your own invalidates the
assessment, as valid evidence must demonstrate your independent knowledge and skills. Your
'own work' should reflect knowledge and skills you could apply in different contexts.
Promoting Academic Authenticity
Burnside High School staff actively promote academic integrity, reinforcing our values by:
● Educating students: Clearly explaining academic authenticity, misconduct (including GenAI
misuse), and potential consequences through school assemblies and teaching programmes.
● Varying assessments: Using diverse assessment types and regularly changing task content to
foster genuine learning.
● Teaching referencing: Instructing students on correct source acknowledgment, distinguishing it
from GenAI output.
1● Setting clear expectations: Providing written and verbal guidelines for assessments, with clear
boundaries on digital tools and AI use.
 GenAI use in assessment is more limited than in teaching and learning.
 For NCEA internal assessments, teachers will follow specific Achievement Standard
requirements and Conditions of Assessment, consulting school and NZQA GenAI
guidance.
● Regular checkpoints: Monitoring student progress through discussions and records to help
identify authentic work.
● Encouraging help-seeking: Fostering an environment where students feel comfortable asking
for help.
● Authenticity declarations: Requiring students to confirm their work is original and compliant
with GenAI policies.
● Consistent marking: Ensuring familiarity with student work to maintain fair and consistent
assessment.
Parents/whānau will also be informed about school policies on academic authenticity and GenAI.
Support from others must not compromise a student's work.
Generative AI in NCEA: Key Messages
● Burnside High School has GenAI guidelines for student (available through the school learning
management system) and staff guiding use of GenAI in both learning and assessment practice.
● Authenticity is paramount in NCEA: Students must demonstrate their own knowledge and skills;
all submitted evidence must be their own work, repeatable in different contexts.
● GenAI use is NOT permitted in NCEA external assessment.
Responding to Possible Academic Misconduct
If an assessor suspects academic misconduct, including improper GenAI use, they may:
● Speak with the student and parents/whānau.
● Compare other student work for inconsistencies.
● Request evidence of the student's process (e.g., drafts, notes).
● Use observations of student progress.
● Utilise text-matching software and other digital tools to detect plagiarism or AI-generated
content.
2All responses uphold natural justice, protecting privacy and wellbeing. The school may seek external
advice as needed.
Consequences of Academic Misconduct
If academic misconduct (including inappropriate GenAI use) is confirmed, actions may include:
● A student warning.
● Further education on academic authenticity.
● Behaviour management processes.
● Review of how the school promotes authenticity.
● Reporting to relevant qualifications authorities (e.g., NZQA).
● A grade of Not Achieved awarded.
In serious cases, consequences could involve stand-down, suspension, or being barred from further
assessments by NZQA. Criminal activity may be reported to the police. Students/parents/whānau
unhappy with outcomes can follow the school's complaints process.

‭ must,‬‭ before‬‭ agreeing‬‭ to‬‭ such‬‭ a‬‭ release,‬‭ take‬‭ all‬‭ reasonable‬‭ steps‬‭ to‬‭ find‬‭ out‬‭ the‬‭ student's‬‭ views‬
‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ matter.‬‭ The‬‭ Principal‬‭ may‬‭ refuse‬‭ to‬‭ agree‬‭ to‬‭ release‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ student‬‭ if‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬
‭ considers‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ inappropriate‬‭ to‬‭ do‬‭ so,‬‭ having‬‭ regard‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ student's‬‭ age,‬‭ maturity,‬‭ and‬‭ ability‬‭ to‬
‭ formulate and express views, and any views the student has expressed.‬
‭ The‬‭ Principal's‬‭ discretion‬‭ to‬‭ refuse‬‭ to‬‭ agree‬‭ to‬‭ release‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ noted‬‭ above‬‭ is‬‭ subject‬‭ to‬
‭ section‬‭ 59‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Education‬‭ and‬‭ Training‬‭ Act‬‭ which‬‭ provides‬‭ that‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ enrolled‬‭ at‬‭ a‬‭ State‬
‭ school‬‭ may‬‭ not‬‭ be‬‭ required‬‭ to‬‭ attend‬‭ or‬‭ take‬‭ part‬‭ in‬‭ any‬‭ religious‬‭ observances‬‭ if‬‭ a‬‭ parent‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ student‬‭ does‬‭ not‬‭ wish‬‭ the‬‭ student‬‭ to‬‭ take‬‭ part‬‭ and‬‭ makes‬‭ this‬‭ wish‬‭ known‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ to‬‭ the‬
‭ Principal.‬
‭ Section‬‭ 51‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Education‬‭ and‬‭ Training‬‭ Act‬‭ allows‬‭ a‬‭ parent‬‭ to‬‭ ask‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ to‬
‭ ensure‬‭ that‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ is‬‭ released‬‭ from‬‭ tuition‬‭ in‬‭ specified‬‭ parts‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ health‬‭ curriculum‬‭ related‬
‭ to‬‭ sexuality‬‭ education.‬‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ must‬‭ ensure‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ student‬‭ is‬‭ supervised‬‭ during‬‭ the‬‭ period‬
‭ of‬‭ release.‬‭ However,‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ is‬‭ not‬‭ required‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ student‬‭ is‬‭ excluded‬‭ at‬‭ any‬
‭ other‬‭ time‬‭ while‬‭ a‬‭ teacher‬‭ deals‬‭ with‬‭ a‬‭ question‬‭ raised‬‭ by‬‭ another‬‭ student‬‭ that‬‭ relates‬‭ to‬‭ the‬

Animal Welfare and Ethics Policy‬
‭ Purpose‬
‭ This policy governs the welfare of any animals under the care of Burnside High School, and‬
‭ the use of animals in teaching, in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act 1999 ("Act"). In‬
‭ broad terms, the Act is designed to protect animals from harmful or inhumane treatment.‬
‭ Policy‬
▪
‬‭ All animals at Burnside High School will be treated with care and respect. Burnside‬
‭ High School will attend properly to the welfare of those animals in accordance with the‬
‭ Act, any relevant code of welfare for the species and good practice.‬
▪
‬‭ Burnside High School will ensure that the proper care and welfare of animals has the‬
‭ highest priority in any activity involving the keeping of an animal or its study on a field‬
‭ trip.‬
▪
‬‭ Burnside High School will only undertake the "manipulation" (as defined in the Act) of‬
‭ live animals for research and teaching to enhance educational outcomes and only‬
‭ where those benefits are not outweighed by the likely harm to the animals. Burnside‬
‭ High School will have due regard to the animal welfare principles of replacement (of‬
‭ animal use with alternatives), reduction (in the numbers of live animals used in‬
‭ teaching) and refinement (of the techniques used to ensure harm is minimised and‬
‭ benefits maximised).‬
‭
‭
‭
‭ Any "manipulation" of live animals will be carried out strictly in accordance with the Act, in‬
‭ accordance with the New Zealand Association of Science Educators ("NZASE") Schools'‬
‭ Animal Ethics Committee Code of Ethical Conduct for the use of animals, with the approval‬
‭ of the NZASE Animal Ethics Committee.‬
‭ Definitions‬
▪
“Animal” is defined as any live member of the animal kingdom that is a mammal‬
‭ (including any mammalian foetus and marsupial pouch young but excluding humans),‬
‭ bird (including any avian pre-hatched young), reptile (including any reptilian‬
‭ pre-hatched young), amphibian, fish, octopus, squid, crab, lobster or crayfish.‬
▪
‬‭ However, other living creatures such as spiders, snails, worms and insects must also be‬
‭ treated with care and kindness.‬
‬‭
‭
‭‭
‭
‭
▪
‬‭ A "manipulation" is something that interferes with an animal’s normal physiology,‬
‭ behaviour or anatomy by subjecting the animal to unusual or abnormal practices or‬
‭ depriving the animal of usual care.‬
▪
‬‭ Observations of animals, taking measurements of growth or breeding animals while‬
‭ studying reproduction are not considered manipulations.‬
▪
‬‭ Similarly, the use of animal cadavers or animal tissue ethically sourced from animals‬
‭ that have been killed for another purpose, is neither the use of an "animal" or a‬
‭ "manipulation".‬
‭ Application‬
‭ Responsibility for the welfare of animals rests with the teacher involved, but ultimately with‬
‭ the Principal and Board.‬
‭ Animals kept at Burnside High School will be provided with their five basic needs (sometimes‬
‭ expressed as the five freedoms).‬
‭ 1.‬‭ Freedom from thirst, hunger, and malnutrition (including during weekends and‬
‭ holidays).‬
‭ 2.‬‭ Freedom from discomfort and lack of shelter (by being provided with appropriate‬
‭ cages or containers that are properly ventilated and hygienic and do not allow‬
‭ exposure to extremes of noise, draughts, and sunlight).‬
‭ 3.‬‭ Freedom from injury, disease, and parasite infestation (by prevention or rapid diagnosis‬
‭ and treatment). Diseased or injured animals will be treated promptly and will not be‬
‭ kept at Burnside High School until they have recovered. If this is not feasible, they will‬
‭ be humanely destroyed.‬
‭ 4.‬‭ Freedom from distress (through proper care and handling).‬
‭ 5.‬‭ Freedom to display their normal patterns of behaviour.‬
‭
▪
‭
‬‭ If the appropriate care cannot be provided, the animal is not to be kept in school.‬
▪
‬‭ Creatures kept in classrooms for observation must be housed and fed properly, and‬
‭ returned to their natural habitat on completion of the study.‬
▪
‬‭ Creatures captured on field trips must be returned to their habitat prior to leaving the‬
‭ area unless their proper care in the School is assured.‬
▪
‬‭ The following principles will apply to undertaking dissection as part of classroom teaching‬
‭ at Burnside High School:‬
▪
‬‭ Dissection will only be used where the Science Faculty considers that such activity will‬
‭ provide material educational value/experience for students;‬
▪
‬‭ Animal dissection will use animal cadavers and tissue sourced from external suppliers of‬
‭ animals (and tissue) that have been killed for another purpose;‬
▪
‭
‬‭ Student participation is optional. Students will be given the choice of whether or not they‬
‭ wish to participate.‬
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭ Animal Welfare and Ethics Policy: UPDATED 22 May 2024‬‭ Page‬‭ 2‬‭
▪
‬‭ Where the use of live animals in any study (including science fair projects) involves a‬
‭ "manipulation" in accordance with the Act, the policy and legal requirements mentioned‬
‭ above will be followed.‬

‭ Appointments Policy: UPDATED 22 May 2024‬‭ Appendix: guidelines on assessment of safety check/police vet results‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ safety‬‭ checking‬‭ and‬‭ police‬‭ vetting‬‭ process‬‭ is‬‭ strictly‬‭ confidential‬‭ and‬‭ must‬‭ respect‬‭ the‬
‭ privacy‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ individual‬‭ the‬‭ subject‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ safety‬‭ check/police‬‭ vet‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬
‭ this Policy ("Applicant").‬
▪
‭ In‬‭ the‬‭ event‬‭ that‬‭ a‬‭ Police‬‭ vet‬‭ details‬‭ a‬‭ conviction,‬‭ the‬‭ Applicant‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ given‬‭ a‬‭ reasonable‬
‭ opportunity‬‭ to‬‭ view‬‭ and‬‭ validate‬‭ or‬‭ dispute‬‭ the‬‭ accuracy‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Police‬‭ vet.‬‭ Depending‬‭ on‬‭ the‬
‭ nature‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ conviction‬‭ revealed‬‭ by‬‭ a‬‭ Police‬‭ vet,‬‭ or‬‭ other‬‭ adverse‬‭ information‬‭ obtained‬‭ during‬
‭ a‬‭ safety‬‭ check,‬‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ may‬‭ choose‬‭ to‬‭ oﬀer‬‭ the‬‭ Applicant‬‭ the‬‭ opportunity‬‭ to‬‭ explain‬‭ the‬
‭ result.‬
▪
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ Police‬‭ vet‬‭ reveals‬‭ the‬‭ Applicant‬‭ has‬‭ been‬‭ convicted‬‭ of‬‭ an‬‭ oﬀence‬‭ the‬‭ following‬‭ type,‬
‭ they must not be employed or engaged by the School:‬
▪
‭ At‬‭ any‬‭ time:‬‭ A‬‭ specified‬‭ oﬀence‬‭ listed‬‭ in‬‭ Schedule‬‭ 2‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Children's‬‭ Act‬‭ (and‬‭ the‬‭ Applicant‬
‭ does not hold an exemption under section 35 of that Act);‬
▪
‭ At‬‭ any‬‭ time‬‭ without‬‭ express‬‭ Board‬‭ approval:‬‭ Sexual‬‭ oﬀences‬‭ and‬‭ in‬‭ particular‬‭ crimes‬‭ involving‬

‭ The‬‭ Board‬‭ may‬‭ from‬‭ time‬‭ to‬‭ time‬‭ stipulate‬‭ other‬‭ specific‬‭ oﬀences‬‭ or‬‭ types‬‭ of‬‭ oﬀences‬‭ deemed‬
‭ unacceptable.‬
▪
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ Police‬‭ vet‬‭ reveals‬‭ convictions‬‭ other‬‭ than‬‭ those‬‭ noted‬‭ above,‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬‭ their‬
‭ nominee(s)‬‭ will‬‭ carry‬‭ out‬‭ a‬‭ risk‬‭ assessment‬‭ (having‬‭ regard‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ matrix‬‭ at‬‭ the‬‭ foot‬‭ of‬‭ this‬
‭ document)‬‭ to‬‭ decide,‬‭ based‬‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ nature‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ previous‬‭ conviction(s),‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ nature‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ role, whether in their opinion the Applicant:‬
▪
‬‭ poses an unacceptable risk to student (or staﬀ) safety or to the School's reputation;‬
▪
‬‭ will be a harmful example for students; or‬
▪
‬‭ is otherwise not suitable for the relevant role for which they are applying.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬‭ their‬‭ nominee(s)‬‭ will‬‭ seek‬‭ further‬‭ information‬‭ as‬‭ needed‬‭ (which‬‭ may‬‭ include‬
‭ expert‬‭ advice,‬‭ referee‬‭ checks,‬‭ and‬‭ seeking‬‭ comment‬‭ from‬‭ the‬‭ Applicant).‬‭ The‬‭ Principal‬‭ may‬
‭ consult‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ and/or‬‭ the‬‭ full‬‭ Board‬‭ where‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ considers‬
‭ that necessary.‬
▪
‬‭ Relevant factors include the following:‬
▪
‭ the‬‭ nature‬‭ and‬‭ gravity‬‭ of‬‭ any‬‭ oﬀence,‬‭ including‬‭ the‬‭ relevance‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ oﬀence‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬
‭ role and environment;‬
▪
‬‭ the number and frequency of convictions (e.g. one-oﬀ oﬀence vs pattern of behaviour)‬
▪
‭ the‬‭ length‬‭ of‬‭ time‬‭ since‬‭ the‬‭ act/omission‬‭ leading‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ conviction‬‭ and‬‭ any‬‭ relevant‬
‭ circumstances‬‭ and‬‭ any‬‭ mitigating‬‭ factors‬‭ surrounding‬‭ the‬‭ conduct‬‭ in‬‭ question‬‭ or‬‭ subsequently‬
‭ (e.g. rehabilitation/steps to change the behaviour and prevent reoccurrence)‬
▪
‬‭ the potential impact on students, staﬀ and the School‬
▪
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ is‬‭ not‬‭ satisfied‬‭ as‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ suitability‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Applicant‬‭ for‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ role,‬‭ the‬

‭
‭Assessment and Reporting Policy
Purpose
● To enhance student achievement through the use of good quality assessment information and
practices.
● To ensure there is a system for providing parents with fair and regular feedback on progress and fair
reporting on final achievements.
● To comply with relevant legislative and regulatory requirements and relevant Ministry of Education
and NZQA requirements, guidance and “best practice”.
Relevant legal requirements
● Under the Education and Training Act 2020, school boards must, relevantly:
 develop and implement teaching and learning programmes that give effect to any applicable
foundation curriculum policy statements and national curriculum statements and give the
school’s students access to a nationally and internationally recognised qualifications system
 ensure that the school’s principal and staff monitor and evaluate the performance of the
school’s students in relation to any applicable foundation curriculum policy statements and
national curriculum statements and any qualifications system offered at the school;
 ensure that information about each individual student’s performance is given to a parent of
the student in a timely manner and in a form that is readily understandable;
● The Education (School Planning and Reporting) Regulations 2023 relevantly requires a school board's
annual report to include (among other things) an evaluation and analysis in plain language of the
school’s students’ progress and achievement as a whole, as assessed against expectations across any
applicable foundation curriculum policy statements and national curriculum statements, and based on
good quality assessment or aromatawai information, including an evaluation and analysis in plain
language of the progress and achievement of students whose needs have not yet been well met.
● "Good quality" assessment information draws on a range of evidence to evaluate the progress and
achievement of students and build a comprehensive picture of student learning across the curriculum.Policy
Assessment
● Assessment information should be used by subject departments to both plan and evaluate teaching
programmes and to identify students for extension or remedial assistance (including by adjusting
learning opportunities, teaching approaches and supports, including seeking additional support from
specialists (National Education and Learning Priorities (NELP) objective 2, priority 4).
● Assessment procedures at Burnside High School must ensure:
 students are fully informed of all assessment arrangements in advance;
 assessments are valid, fair, reliable and manageable;
 assessments are linked to the learning objectives of the curriculum and the level the student is
studying at;
 within subject departments, formal assessments should be common across classes of similar
ability, have common marking schedules and be moderated, recorded and reported on, so
that students and parents receive valid feedback on achievement.
● The use of formative assessment is encouraged in all departments. This may include self, peer and
teacher assessment and provides constructive feedback on what has been achieved and helpful feed
forward on what needs to be done next to improve achievement further.
● Assessment must be authentic. Assessment is authentic when it affirms the skills, knowledge and
competencies acquired by students, and reflects real world contexts. Burnside High School as a school
with "consent to assess" will maintain an Academic Authenticity Policy to support assessment practice,
including the acceptable use of Generative AI.
● Faculties and subject departments are required to have Assessment Guidelines, based on School-wide
guidelines, in place to ensure that all formative and summative assessment procedures and practices
in the senior school meet the requirements of NZQA. Similar guidelines need to be in place for all
courses delivered in the junior school.
● The Deputy Principal – Achievement, oversees processes and procedures and reports back to the
Senior Leadership, the Assessment and Reporting Committee and the Curriculum Leaders Team.
● Consent to assess status for the School is applied for and maintained in line with NZQA guidelines.
● The Principal’s Nominee (a staff member nominated by the Principal of a school with "consent to
assess" responsible for ensuring staff members carry out their duties appropriately in relation to NZQA
assessments and responsible for the school's communication with NZQA) must annually inform
students (Years 11, 12 and 13) and teachers of current NCEA procedures and associated school
guidelines.
2● The School maintains internal procedures and an internal quality management system for assessment
to meet the requirements of the New Zealand Qualifications and Credentials Framework (NZQCF).
● Subject Faculty Heads meet during biannual reviews to assure their Supervising Deputy Principal or the
Principal that the School's, and relevant NZQA, Assessment Guidelines are current, complete and are
being implemented appropriately.
● This policy applies to all student assessment at all levels.
Reporting
● The School gives feedback to students/caregivers throughout the year by way of written reports that
align with applicable legislative and regulatory requirements and Ministry/NZQA guidance.
● The format, timing and nature of reports is to be reviewed annually and is published as a Reporting
and Assessment Calendar. This is available to staff on the internal Burnside High School reporting
Google site.
● Copies of reports are retained by the School which are archived in electronic format. Electronic copies
of reports are retained by the School for no longer than 2 years after the student has left.
● Parents/caregivers may request, through the Divisional Principal, special reports on progress between
formal reports.
● Fortnightly Reports are sent to the parent/caregiver of all students with information about
engagement and attitude, attendance and a list of "shout out" awards received.
● Subject Faculty Heads meet each year to provide an annual analysis of assessment results for the
Principal.
● Evaluation of the student progress and achievement as a whole across the School is reported on
through the Annual Report which is published on the School's website.
● Staff are provided with report writing guidelines, and the school is committed to meeting NZQA ‘best
practice’ standards.
‭ Attendance Policy‬
‭ Purpose‬
‭ Attendance is linked to both student wellbeing and to attainment:‬
▪
▪
"The‬‭ research‬‭ shows‬‭ that‬‭ more‬‭ frequent‬‭ non‑attendance‬‭ is‬‭ associated‬‭ with‬‭ worse‬‭ wellbeing‬
‭ outcomes,‬‭ including‬‭ schoolwork‑related‬‭ anxiety,‬‭ decreased‬‭ sense‬‭ of‬‭ belonging,‬‭ fewer‬
‭ friendships‬‭ with‬‭ peers,‬‭ exposure‬‭ to‬‭ bullying,‬‭ and‬‭ feeling‬‭ like‬‭ teachers‬‭ are‬‭ being‬‭ unfair.‬‭ The‬
‭ relationship‬‭ between‬‭ attendance‬‭ and‬‭ wellbeing‬‭ works‬‭ both‬‭ ways:‬‭ poor‬‭ wellbeing‬‭ leads‬‭ to‬‭ poor‬
‭ attendance, and poor attendance leads to poor wellbeing"
‬‭ (source Education Review Oﬃce)‬
‬‭
"Recent‬‭ research‬‭
"
‬‭ shows‬‭ that‬‭ each‬‭ additional‬‭ half‬‭ day‬‭ absence‬‭ from‬‭ school‬‭ predicts‬‭ a‬
‭ consistent‬‭ reduction‬‭ in‬‭ the‬‭ number‬‭ of‬‭ NCEA‬‭ credits‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ subsequently‬‭ attains‬‭
–
‬‭ whether‬
‭ that‬‭ is‬‭ the‬‭ student‬‭ moving‬‭ from‬‭ 100%‬‭ to‬‭ 99%‬‭ attendance‬‭ or‬‭ moving‬‭ from‬‭ 71%‬‭ to‬‭ 70%‬
‭ attendance.‬‭ Students‬‭ who‬‭ are‬‭ absent‬‭ even‬‭ 5-10%‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ time‬‭ (still‬‭ considered‬‭
“regular”
‬
‭ attendance)‬‭ obtain‬‭ fewer‬‭ NCEA‬‭ credits‬‭ than‬‭ those‬‭ with‬‭ slightly‬‭ higher‬‭ attendance.‬‭ There‬‭ is‬‭ no‬
“safe” level of non-attendance"
‬‭ (source Education‬‭ Counts)‬
‭
‬
‭
‭
‭
‭ Under the Education and Training Act 2020:‬
▪
‬‭ A‬‭ student‬‭ is‬‭ required‬‭ to‬‭ attend‬‭ school‬‭ whenever‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ open‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ must‬‭ take‬‭ all‬
‭ reasonable‬‭ steps‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ school's‬‭ students‬‭ attend‬‭ the‬‭ school‬‭ when‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ open‬‭ (section‬
‭ 36)‬
▪
‬‭ A‬‭ parent‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ commits‬‭ an‬‭ oﬀence‬‭ if‬‭ the‬‭ student,‬‭ while‬‭ enrolled‬‭ at‬‭ a‬‭ school,‬‭ does‬‭ not‬
‭ attend the school as required (section 244)‬
▪
‭ Parents/caregivers‬‭ have‬‭ a‬‭ responsibility‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ students‬‭ attend,‬‭ and‬‭ need‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ aware‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ importance of attendance, attendance requirements, and how often their student is attending.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ school‬‭ has‬‭ a‬‭ responsibility‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ attendance,‬‭ and‬‭ this‬‭ policy‬‭ sets‬‭ out‬‭ the‬‭ ways‬
‭ attendance is encouraged, monitored, followed up and reviewed.‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬‭ Education‬‭ considers‬‭ that‬‭ for‬‭ a‬‭ school‬‭ student‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭
“attending‬‭ regularly”
‬‭ in‬
‭ order‬‭ to‬‭ avoid‬‭ compromising‬‭ learning‬‭ opportunities,‬‭ then‬‭ their‬‭ rate‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ at‬‭ least‬‭ 90%‬
‭ present‬‭
-
‬‭ which‬‭ over‬‭ a‬‭ 40‬‭ week‬‭ year‬‭ represents‬‭ a‬‭ total‬‭ of‬‭ four‬‭ weeks‬‭ absent‬‭ during‬‭ term‬‭ time.‬
‭ The Government has a target of 80% of students present for 90% of the term by 2030.‬
‭
‭
‭
‬
‭
‬
‭
‭ Policy‬
▪
‭
‬
‭ All‬‭ students‬‭ of‬‭ Burnside‬‭ High‬‭ School‬‭ are‬‭ expected‬‭ to‬‭ attend‬‭ scheduled‬‭ classes,‬‭ form‬‭ meetings,‬
‭ assemblies and other activities during the school day.‬‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
▪
‭ Attendance‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ recorded‬‭ for‬‭ each‬‭ student‬‭ on‬‭ a‬‭ period‬‭ by‬‭ period‬‭ basis,‬‭ and‬‭ unexplained‬‭ absence‬
‭ will be followed up by form teachers, deans and divisional principals.‬
▪
‬‭ Attendance‬‭ information‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ included‬‭ in‬‭ students’
‬‭ reports.‬‭ Where‬‭ there‬‭ is‬‭ concern‬‭ regarding‬
‭ attendance, the school will communicate this to parents/caregivers at the time.‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ importance‬‭ of,‬‭ and‬‭ expectations‬‭ regarding,‬‭ attendance‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ communicated‬‭ to‬‭ all‬
‭ parents/caregivers in general communications from time to time.‬
▪
‭ Consistent‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬‭ Education's‬‭ definition‬‭ of‬‭ regular‬‭ attendance,‬‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ expects‬
‭ attendance above 90% and percentage attendance will be recorded in students' fortnightly reports.‬
▪
‭ Divisions‬‭ will‬‭ identify‬‭ students‬‭ at‬‭ risk‬‭ of‬‭ material‬‭ non-attendance‬‭ and‬‭ monitor‬‭ the‬‭ attendance‬‭ of‬
‭ those students with the support of the School's Attendance Mentor.‬
▪
‭ A‬‭ range‬‭ of‬‭ pastoral‬‭ procedures‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ followed‬‭ when‬‭ students‬‭ are‬‭ identified‬‭ as‬‭ non-attending,‬
‭ which‬‭ will‬‭ include‬‭ escalating‬‭ communication‬‭ with‬‭ whanau‬‭ and‬‭ appropriate‬‭ support‬‭ wherever‬
‭ practicable‬‭ and‬‭ may‬‭ ultimately‬‭ include‬‭ potential‬‭ referral‬‭ to‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬‭ Education‬‭ Attendance‬
‭ Services.‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ above‬‭ escalation‬‭ approach‬‭ reflects‬‭ the‬‭ Government's‬‭
"Stepped‬‭ Attendance‬‭ Response"
‬‭ (STAR)‬
‭ system.‬‭ STAR‬‭ is‬‭ designed‬‭ to‬‭ set‬‭ expectations‬‭ for‬‭ school,‬‭ student,‬‭ parent/guardian,‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬
‭ Education‬‭ and‬‭ broader‬‭ system‬‭ responses‬‭ to‬‭ student‬‭ absence.‬‭ It‬‭ provides‬‭ a‬‭ series‬‭ of‬‭ activities‬‭ (for‬
‭ each‬‭ of‬‭ parent/guardians,‬‭ schools‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬‭ Education)‬‭ that‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ considered‬‭ when‬
‭ students‬‭ meet‬‭ absence‬‭ thresholds.‬‭ The‬‭ actions‬‭ taken‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ tailored‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ reasons‬‭ for‬‭ absence,‬‭ for‬
‭ example‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ with‬‭ a‬‭ chronic‬‭ illness‬‭ will‬‭ require‬‭ tailored‬‭ supports‬‭ for‬‭ their‬‭ education.‬‭ Burnside‬
‭ High‬‭ School's‬‭ pastoral‬‭ procedures‬‭ in‬‭ dealing‬‭ with‬‭ absences‬‭ will‬‭ reflect‬‭ the‬‭ Government's‬‭ STAR‬
‭ system.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ develop‬‭ and‬‭ implement‬‭ an‬‭ attendance‬‭ management‬‭ plan‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬
‭ regulations.‬‭ As‬‭ at‬‭ the‬‭ date‬‭ of‬‭ this‬‭ Policy,‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ anticipated‬‭ that‬‭ legislative‬‭ and‬‭ regulatory‬‭ change‬‭ will‬
‭ be implemented requiring an Attendance Management Plan by Term 1, 2026.‬
‬
‬
‬
‬
‬
‭ Attendance Requirements by School Bylaws‬
‭ The School bylaws set the following requirements regarding attendance:‬
▪
‬‭
"Regular‬‭ attendance‬‭ and‬‭ punctuality‬‭ are‬‭ personal‬‭ habits‬‭ which‬‭ are‬‭ needed‬‭ and‬‭ valued‬‭ both‬‭ within‬
‭ the school and in the workplace.‬
▪
‭ Students‬‭ are‬‭ expected‬‭ to‬‭ attend‬‭ school‬‭ at‬‭ all‬‭ times‬‭ unless‬‭ they‬‭ are‬‭ absent‬‭ because‬‭ of‬‭ sickness‬‭ or‬
‭ important family reason.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ school‬‭ is‬‭ legally‬‭ required‬‭ to‬‭ monitor‬‭ attendance.‬‭ Attendance‬‭ and‬‭ punctuality‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ recorded‬
‭ each period and a summary of this information will be reported to parents/caregivers.‬
‭ 2.1‬‭ Students‬‭ must‬‭ attend‬‭ and‬‭ be‬‭ on‬‭ time‬‭ for‬‭ all‬‭ timetabled‬‭ classes‬‭ and‬‭ activities‬‭ e.g.‬‭ assemblies,‬‭ form‬
‭ times, field-trips and work exploration.‬
‭ 2.2‬‭ School‬‭ classroom‬‭ hours‬‭ are‬‭ from‬‭ 8.15am‬‭ to‬‭ 2.40pm‬‭ (except‬‭ Monday’s‬‭ when‬‭ school‬‭ starts‬‭ at‬‭ 9.00am‬
‭ and‬‭ Wednesdays‬‭ when‬‭ school‬‭ closes‬‭ at‬‭ 2.30pm).‬‭ Students‬‭ must‬‭ attend‬‭ all‬‭ classes‬‭ between‬‭ these‬
‭ hours.‬
‭ 2.3‬‭ Absence‬‭ from‬‭ school‬‭ for‬‭ family,‬‭ health‬‭ or‬‭ other‬‭ reasons‬‭ must‬‭ be‬‭ accounted‬‭ for‬‭ by‬
‭ parents/caregivers‬‭ (in‬‭ advance‬‭ where‬‭ appropriate),‬‭ with‬‭ a‬‭ written‬‭ explanation,‬‭ medical‬‭ certificate,‬

- notify the School if their student is going to be absent‬‭ by phone, text, or email by 8.30am‬
-
‭
‬‭ seek‬‭ permission‬‭ in‬‭ advance‬‭ for‬‭ prolonged,‬‭ regular‬‭ or‬‭ otherwise‬‭ exceptional‬‭ absences‬‭ (e.g.‬‭ for‬
‭ sporting, religious or cultural reasons). Board approval may be required.‬
- try to arrange appointments etc. outside school hours or in holidays‬
- work with the school to manage any attendance issues.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ send‬‭ a‬‭ text‬‭ message‬‭ to‬‭ parents/caregivers‬‭ requesting,‬‭ a‬‭ reply‬‭ by‬‭ text‬‭ or‬‭ phone‬‭ with‬
‭ a‬‭ reason,‬‭ if‬‭ a‬‭ student‬‭ is‬‭ recorded‬‭ absent‬‭ from‬‭ school‬‭ and‬‭ no‬‭ notification‬‭ has‬‭ been‬‭ received‬‭ in‬

▪
‬‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ code‬‭ all‬‭ absences‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬‭ Education‬‭ directed‬‭ attendance‬
‭ codes and categorisations.‬
▪
‭ A‬‭ student‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ recorded‬‭ with‬‭ an‬‭
"unjustified‬‭ absence"
‬‭ where‬‭ no‬‭ justifiable‬‭ explanation‬‭ is‬
‭ received,‬‭ or‬‭ the‬‭ explanation‬‭ does‬‭ not‬‭ fall‬‭ within‬‭ the‬‭ schools'
‬‭ protocols‬‭ for‬‭ justified‬‭ absences,‬
‭ including family holidays during term time in New Zealand or overseas.‬

‬‭ The‬‭ separate‬‭ Access‬‭ to‬‭ Students‬‭ Policy‬‭ sets‬‭ out‬‭ the‬‭ procedures‬‭ for‬‭ allowing‬‭ access‬‭ to‬‭ students,‬‭ or‬
‭ allowing students to be released from tuition, during school time‬
▪
‭ Specific‬‭ permission‬‭ is‬‭ required‬‭ in‬‭ advance‬‭ for‬‭ prolonged,‬‭ regular‬‭ or‬‭ otherwise‬‭ exceptional‬‭ absences‬
‭ (e.g.‬‭ for‬‭ sporting,‬‭ religious‬‭ or‬‭ cultural‬‭ reasons).‬‭ Approval‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ (or‬‭ the‬‭ Board's‬‭ delegate)‬‭ is‬
‭ required‬‭ for‬‭ such‬‭ requests‬‭ which‬‭ must‬‭ be‬‭ truly‬‭ exceptional.‬‭ In‬‭ considering‬‭ such‬‭ requests,‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬
‭ (or‬‭ its‬‭ delegate)‬‭ will‬‭ have‬‭ regard,‬‭ among‬‭ other‬‭ things,‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ school‬‭ time‬‭ missed‬‭ due‬‭ to‬‭ such‬
‭ absences,‬‭ the‬‭ student's‬‭ School‬‭ performance‬‭ and‬‭ ability‬‭ to‬‭
'catch-up'
‬‭ on‬‭ missed‬‭ classwork,‬‭ the‬‭ level‬
‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ sporting/cultural‬‭ activity‬‭ (if‬‭ applicable)‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ principles‬‭ of‬‭ this‬‭ Policy.‬‭ Approval‬
‭ may be granted or refused (with or without conditions) on a case by case basis.‬

‭ issued under ‬‭ the‬‭ Education and Training Act; and‬

▪
‭ together‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ and‬‭ teaching‬‭ staﬀ,‬‭ use‬‭ good‬‭ quality‬‭ assessment‬‭ or‬‭ aromatawai‬

‭ of Conduct itself) set out in Appendix 4.‬
▪
‭
‬
‭ All‬‭ Board‬‭ members,‬‭ regardless‬‭ of‬‭ how‬‭ they‬‭ came‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ Board‬‭ members,‬‭ have‬‭ an‬‭ equal‬‭ voice,‬

‭ all the information at hand and are then collectively responsible for the Board’s decisions.‬
‭ Elections‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ Board‬‭ may‬‭ appoint‬‭ an‬‭ appropriate‬‭ external‬‭ provider‬‭ (such‬‭ as‬‭ Schooled)‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ the‬
‭ Returning‬‭ Oﬃcer‬‭ for‬‭ the‬‭ election‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ parent‬‭ representatives,‬‭ the‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ representative,‬‭ and‬
‭ the student representative.‬
▪
‭ Elections‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ conducted‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ procedures‬‭ set‬‭ out‬‭ in‬‭ Schedule‬‭ 23‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ Act‬‭ in‬‭ every‬‭ election‬‭ year‬‭ (being‬‭ a‬‭ year‬‭ divisible‬‭ by‬‭ 3)‬‭ or‬‭ annually‬‭ in‬‭ the‬‭ case‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ student‬
‭ representative.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ Board‬‭ may‬‭ decide,‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ Schedule‬‭ 23‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Act,‬‭ to‬‭ adopt‬‭ a‬‭ staggered‬
‭ election‬‭ cycle‬‭ in‬‭ which‬‭ half‬‭ the‬‭ number‬‭ of‬‭ its‬‭ parent‬‭ representatives‬‭ are‬‭ elected‬‭ at‬‭ an‬
‭ election‬‭ held‬‭ at‬‭ a‬‭ mid-term‬‭ election,‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ remainder‬‭ are‬‭ elected‬‭ at‬‭ an‬‭ election‬‭ held‬‭ in‬‭ an‬
‭ election year.‬

‭ Role of the Principal‬
‭ The‬‭ Principal‬‭ is‬‭ the‬‭ Board's‬‭ chief‬‭ executive‬‭ in‬‭ relation‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ School's‬‭ control‬‭ and‬‭ management‬
‭ (s130,‬‭ Education‬‭ and‬‭ Training‬‭ Act‬‭ 2020).‬‭ While‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ must‬‭ work‬‭ within‬‭ the‬‭ law‬‭ and‬‭ the‬
‭ Board’s‬‭ general‬‭ policy‬‭ directions,‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ otherwise‬‭ has‬‭ complete‬‭ discretion‬‭ to‬‭ manage‬‭ the‬
‭ School's‬‭ day-to-day‬‭ administration‬‭ as‬‭ they‬‭ see‬‭ fit‬‭ (s130,‬‭ Education‬‭ and‬‭ Training‬‭ Act‬‭ 2020).‬‭ The‬
‭ Board Governance Policy‬‭ Page‬‭ 3‬‭ of‬‭ 20‬‭ Principal may, in turn, delegate some of that responsibility to other staﬀ members.‬
‭
‭ The Presiding Member (Chair)‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ Board‬‭ is‬‭ required‬‭ to‬‭ appoint‬‭ a‬‭ member‬‭ (not‬‭ being‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬‭ a‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ or‬‭ student‬
‭ representative) to preside at Board meetings.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ appointment‬‭ must‬‭ be‬‭ made‬‭ at‬‭ the‬‭ first‬‭ Board‬‭ meeting‬‭ in‬‭ any‬‭ year,‬‭ unless‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ an‬‭ election‬
‭ year, in which case it must be at the first meeting after the election.‬
▪
‭ In‬‭ addition‬‭ to‬‭ chairing‬‭ Board‬‭ meetings,‬‭ the‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ is‬‭ responsible‬‭ for‬‭ developing‬
‭ and maintaining a productive working relationship with the Principal.‬
‭
‬

‭ meeting),‬‭ and‬‭ at‬‭ other‬‭ times‬‭ by‬‭ agreement‬‭ at‬‭ the‬‭ previous‬‭ meeting‬‭ or‬‭ when‬‭ determined‬‭ by‬
‭ the Presiding Member.‬
▪
‬‭ Meetings‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ held‬‭ at‬‭ a‬‭ time‬‭ and‬‭ place‬‭ determined‬‭ at‬‭ the‬‭ previous‬‭ meeting‬‭ (or‬‭ by‬‭ the‬
‭ Presiding‬‭ Member),‬‭ or‬‭ by‬‭ means‬‭ of‬‭ audio,‬‭ audiovisual,‬‭ or‬‭ electronic‬‭ communication‬‭ so‬‭ long‬
‭ as‬‭ all‬‭ participating‬‭ Board‬‭ members‬‭ have‬‭ access‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ technology‬‭ needed‬‭ to‬‭ participate‬‭ in‬
‭ such‬‭ a‬‭ meeting‬‭ and‬‭ a‬‭ quorum‬‭ of‬‭ members‬‭ can‬‭ simultaneously‬‭ communicate‬‭ with‬‭ each‬‭ other‬
‭ throughout the meeting.‬
▪
‭ No‬‭ business‬‭ shall‬‭ be‬‭ transacted‬‭ at‬‭ any‬‭ meeting‬‭ unless‬‭ a‬‭ quorum‬‭ (being‬‭ more‬‭ than‬‭ half‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ Board‬‭ members‬‭ then‬‭ holding‬‭ oﬃce)‬‭ is‬‭ present‬‭ (or‬‭ able‬‭ to‬‭ participate‬‭ by‬‭ audio,‬‭ audiovisual,‬
‭ or electronic communication in the manner set out above).‬
▪
‭ Every‬‭ question‬‭ shall‬‭ be‬‭ decided‬‭ by‬‭ a‬‭ majority‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ votes‬‭ cast‬‭ on‬‭ it‬‭ by‬‭ Board‬‭ members‬
‭ present,‬‭ except‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ has‬‭ a‬‭ casting‬‭ vote‬‭ when‬‭ the‬‭ deliberative‬‭ votes‬
‭ are equal.‬
▪
‭ A‬‭ resolution‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ signed‬‭ or‬‭ assented‬‭ to‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ (whether‬‭ sent‬‭ by‬‭ post,‬‭ courier,‬‭ or‬
‭ electronic‬‭ communication)‬‭ by‬‭ all‬‭ Board‬‭ members‬‭ is‬‭ as‬‭ valid‬‭ and‬‭ eﬀectual‬‭ as‬‭ if‬‭ it‬‭ had‬‭ been‬
‭ passed at a meeting of the Board.‬
▪
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ is‬‭ not‬‭ present‬‭ at‬‭ a‬‭ meeting‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Board,‬‭ any‬‭ other‬‭ Board‬‭ member‬
‭ (not‬‭ being‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬‭ the‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ or‬‭ student‬‭ representative)‬‭ appointed‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ at‬‭ the‬
‭ meeting must preside (chair).‬

‭ Public access to meetings‬
▪
▪
▪
▪
‭ Board‬‭ meetings‬‭ are‬‭ not‬‭ public‬‭ meetings,‬‭ but‬‭ they‬‭ are‬‭ held‬‭ in‬‭ public‬‭ wherever‬‭ possible‬‭ so‬
‭ that‬‭ members‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ community‬‭ can‬‭ attend.‬‭ The‬‭ Board‬‭ is‬‭ obliged‬‭ to‬‭ take‬‭ all‬‭ reasonable‬‭ steps‬
‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ that‬‭ parents‬‭ can‬‭ readily‬‭ find‬‭ out,‬‭ within‬‭ a‬‭ reasonable‬‭ time‬‭ before‬‭ each‬‭ meeting,‬
‭ where‬‭ and‬‭ when‬‭ meetings‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ are‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ held.‬‭ To‬‭ that‬‭ end,‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ will‬‭ arrange‬
‭ for a schedule of its planned meetings to be published on the School website.‬
‭ Members‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ public‬‭ may‬‭ speak‬‭ in‬‭ open‬‭ meetings‬‭ by‬‭ invitation‬‭ from‬‭ the‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬
‭ or when the members present resolve to give speaking rights.‬
‭ The‬‭ Board‬‭ may,‬‭ by‬‭ resolution,‬‭ exclude‬‭ the‬‭ public‬‭ from‬‭ the‬‭ whole‬‭ or‬‭ any‬‭ part‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ meeting‬‭ on‬
‭ one‬‭ or‬‭ more‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ grounds‬‭ set‬‭ out‬‭ in‬‭ the‬‭ Oﬃcial‬‭ Information‬‭ Act‬‭ where‬‭ the‬‭ public‬‭ conduct‬
‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ meeting‬‭ would‬‭ be‬‭ likely‬‭ to‬‭ result‬‭ in‬‭ the‬‭ disclosure‬‭ of‬‭ information‬‭ for‬‭ which‬‭ good‬
‭ reason‬‭ for‬‭ withholding‬‭ would‬‭ exist‬‭ under‬‭ that‬‭ Act‬‭ (e.g.‬‭ protection‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ privacy‬‭ of‬‭ natural‬
‭ persons).‬‭ See‬‭ section‬‭ 46(7)‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Local‬‭ Government‬‭ Oﬃcial‬‭ Information‬‭ and‬‭ Meetings‬‭ Act‬
‭ 1987.‬
‭ The‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ may,‬‭ if‬‭ they‬‭ believe,‬‭ on‬‭ reasonable‬‭ grounds,‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ behaviour‬‭ of‬
‭ any‬‭ member‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ public‬‭ attending‬‭ that‬‭ meeting‬‭ is‬‭ likely‬‭ to‬‭ prejudice‬‭ or‬‭ to‬‭ continue‬‭ to‬
‭ prejudice‬‭ the‬‭ orderly‬‭ conduct‬‭ of‬‭ that‬‭ meeting‬‭ if‬‭ that‬‭ member‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ public‬‭ is‬‭ permitted‬‭ to‬

‭ Child Protection Policy‬
‭ Introduction and Purpose‬
‭ Burnside‬‭ High‬‭ School‬‭ is‬‭ committed‬‭ to‬‭ providing‬‭ a‬‭ safe‬‭ environment‬‭ free‬‭ from‬‭ physical,‬‭ emotional,‬‭ verbal‬‭ or‬
‭ sexual abuse and to the prevention of child abuse and neglect.‬
‭ Part‬‭ 2‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Children's‬‭ Act‬‭ 2014‬‭ requires‬‭ school‬‭ boards‬‭ to‬‭ adopt‬‭ a‬‭ child‬‭ protection‬‭ policy‬‭ that‬‭ must‬‭ contain‬
‭ provisions on the identification and reporting of child abuse and neglect.‬
‭ This‬‭ policy‬‭ describes‬‭ the‬‭ processes‬‭ and‬‭ procedures‬‭ that‬‭ Burnside‬‭ High‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ follow‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ children‬
‭ are‬‭ safe,‬‭ and‬‭ that‬‭ incidents‬‭ of‬‭ suspected‬‭ and‬‭ potential‬‭ child‬‭ abuse‬‭ and‬‭ neglect‬‭ are‬‭ identified‬‭ and‬‭ responded‬
‭ to appropriately.‬
‭ Principles‬
▪
‬‭ This‬‭ policy‬‭ sets‬‭ the‬‭ framework‬‭ for‬‭ the‬‭ board's‬‭ expectations‬‭ around‬‭ child‬‭ safety.‬‭ The‬‭ Principal‬‭ has‬
‭ delegated authority to develop, review and amend the procedures that support this policy.‬
▪
‬‭ The interests and protection of the child are paramount in all circumstances.‬
▪
‬‭ We‬‭ recognise‬‭ that‬‭ children‬‭ have‬‭ a‬‭ fundamental‬‭ right‬‭ to‬‭ have‬‭ their‬‭ needs‬‭ met‬‭ in‬‭ an‬‭ environment‬‭ safe‬
‭ from abuse and neglect.‬
▪
‬‭ All‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ able‬‭ to‬‭ identify‬‭ the‬‭ signs‬‭ and‬‭ symptoms‬‭ of‬‭ potential‬‭ abuse‬‭ and‬‭ neglect;‬‭ deal‬‭ with‬
‭ disclosures‬‭ by‬‭ children‬‭ and‬‭ allegations‬‭ against‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ members;‬‭ and‬‭ take‬‭ appropriate‬‭ action‬‭ in‬
‭ response.‬
▪
‬‭ We recognise the rights of family/whānau to participate in the decision-making about their children.‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ work‬‭ with‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ and‬‭ partner‬‭ agencies‬‭ and‬‭ organisations‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ this‬‭ child‬‭ protection‬
‭ policy‬‭ and‬‭ related‬‭ procedures‬‭ are‬‭ understood‬‭ and‬‭ implemented‬‭ and‬‭ concerns‬‭ about‬‭ the‬‭ wellbeing‬‭ of‬
‭ a child are appropriately addressed.‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ promote‬‭ a‬‭ culture‬‭ where‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ feel‬‭ confident‬‭ that‬‭ they‬‭ can‬‭ constructively‬‭ challenge‬
‭ poor practice or raise issues of concern in relation to child safety without fear of reprisal.‬
▪
‬‭ The School will at all times comply with relevant legislative requirements and responsibilities.‬
▪
‬‭ We‬‭ accept‬‭ our‬‭ statutory‬‭ responsibilities‬‭ to‬‭ engage‬‭ in‬‭ safe‬‭ employment‬‭ and‬‭ contracting‬‭ practices‬‭ and‬
‭ play a role in the prevention, identification and reporting of child abuse and neglect.‬
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭‭
‭ Guidelines‬
▪
‬‭ Any‬‭ person‬‭ in‬‭ our‬‭ School‬‭ who‬‭ believes‬‭ that‬‭ any‬‭ child‬‭ or‬‭ young‬‭ person‬‭ has‬‭ been‬‭ or‬‭ is‬‭ likely‬‭ to‬‭ be‬
‭ harmed‬‭ (whether‬‭ physically,‬‭ emotionally‬‭ or‬‭ sexually),‬‭ ill-treated,‬‭ abused,‬‭ neglected‬‭ or‬‭ deprived‬‭ must‬
‭ follow‬‭ school‬‭ procedures‬‭ and‬‭ report‬‭ the‬‭ matter‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ School's‬‭ Child‬‭ Protection‬‭ Coordinator.‬
‭ Procedures‬‭ are‬‭ in‬‭ place‬‭ to‬‭ identify,‬‭ respond‬‭ to‬‭ and‬‭ report‬‭ allegations‬‭ regarding‬‭ abuse‬‭ (refer‬‭ Appendix‬
‭ 1a, 1b and 1c).‬
▪
‭ Procedures‬‭ are‬‭ in‬‭ place‬‭ to‬‭ deal‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ possibility‬‭ of‬‭ an‬‭ allegation‬‭ involving‬‭ a‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member‬‭ (refer‬
‭ Appendix 2a and 2b).‬
▪
‭
‬‭ The School will appoint a Child Protection Coordinator with the responsibilities set out in Appendix 3‬‭ .‬
▪
‬‭ Advice‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ sought‬‭ from‬‭ appropriate‬‭ advisors‬‭ (e.g.‬‭ NZSTA‬‭ advisors‬‭ and/or‬‭ School‬‭ lawyers)‬‭ on‬
‭ employment matters, and from other relevant agencies where child safety issues arise.‬
▪
‭ Professional‬‭ development,‬‭ resources‬‭ and/or‬‭ advice‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ provided‬‭ to‬‭ ensure‬‭ all‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ understand‬
‭ and can carry out their roles in terms of this policy‬‭ (refer Appendix 4).‬
▪
‭ Explanation‬‭ and‬‭ discussion‬‭ of‬‭ this‬‭ policy‬‭ will‬‭ form‬‭ part‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ induction‬‭ programme‬‭ for‬‭ each‬‭ new‬‭ staﬀ‬
‭ member.‬
▪
‬‭ Relevant‬‭ information‬‭ in‬‭ relation‬‭ to‬‭ child‬‭ safety‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ securely‬‭ stored‬‭ (accessible‬‭ only‬‭ by‬‭ authorised‬
‭ persons)‬‭ and‬‭ used‬‭ and‬‭ disclosed‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ Privacy‬‭ Act‬‭ 2020‬‭ (including‬‭ any‬‭ applicable‬
‭ code‬‭ of‬‭ practice)‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ Oranga‬‭ Tamariki‬‭ Act‬‭ 1989.‬‭ In‬‭ particular,‬‭ information‬‭ held‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ School‬
‭ relating‬‭ to‬‭ or‬‭ aﬀecting‬‭ the‬‭ safety‬‭ or‬‭ well-being‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ child‬‭ or‬‭ young‬‭ person‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ provided‬‭ to‬‭ Oranga‬
‭ Tamariki,‬‭ a‬‭ care‬‭ and‬‭ protection‬‭ co-ordinator‬‭ or‬‭ the‬‭ Police‬‭ on‬‭ request‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ the‬
‭ information‬‭ sharing‬‭ provisions‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Oranga‬‭ Tamariki‬‭ Act‬‭ and‬‭ having‬‭ regard‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ statutory‬‭ principle‬
‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ well-being‬‭ and‬‭ best‬‭ interests‬‭ of‬‭ any‬‭ child‬‭ or‬‭ young‬‭ person,‬‭ in‬‭ general,‬‭ take‬‭ precedence‬‭ over‬
‭ any‬‭ duty‬‭ of‬‭ confidentiality‬‭ owed‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ in‬‭ relation‬‭ to‬‭ that‬‭ child‬‭ or‬‭ young‬‭ person‬‭ or‬‭ any‬‭ family‬
‭ member.‬
▪
‬‭ The following information should be securely stored:‬
−
‬‭ The record of the concern;‬
−
‬‭ A record of any related discussions, including copies of correspondence, where appropriate;‬
−
‬‭ A record of any advice received;‬
−
‬‭ The action the school took, including rationale;‬
−
‬‭ Any‬‭ earlier‬‭ concerns,‬‭ if‬‭ the‬‭ notification‬‭ is‬‭ based‬‭ on‬‭ an‬‭ accumulation‬‭ of‬‭ concerns‬‭ (rather‬‭ than‬‭ a‬
‭ specific incident).‬
▪
‭
‬‭ The‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ apply‬‭ safe‬‭ recruitment‬‭ practices‬‭ (including‬‭ undertaking‬‭ safety‬‭ checks‬‭ or‬‭ police‬
‭ vetting)‬‭ in‬‭ line‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ requirements‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Children's‬‭ Act‬‭ 2014‬‭ and‬‭ Schedule‬‭ 4‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Education‬‭ and‬
‭ Training Act 2020 and the School's "Appointment of Staﬀ" Policy.‬
▪
‬‭ In‬‭ addition‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ statutory‬‭ requirements‬‭ for‬‭ safety‬‭ checks‬‭ and‬‭ police‬‭ vetting‬‭ of‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ and‬‭ contractors,‬
‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ will‬‭ seek‬‭ police‬‭ vets‬‭ from‬‭ volunteers‬‭ in‬‭ appropriate‬‭ circumstances,‬‭ taking‬‭ a‬‭ risk-based‬
‭ approach‬‭ and‬‭ being‬‭ guided‬‭ by‬‭ this‬‭ Policy‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ School's‬‭ Health‬‭ and‬‭ Safety‬‭ Policy.‬‭ The‬‭ Board‬
‭ considers‬‭ it‬‭ appropriate‬‭ to‬‭ request‬‭ a‬‭ police‬‭ vet‬‭ from‬‭ a‬‭ volunteer‬‭ if‬‭ that‬‭ person‬‭ is‬‭ reasonably‬‭ likely‬‭ to‬
‭ have unsupervised access to students, including on an overnight trip or team coaches/managers.‬

‭ Policy‬
‭ Where to address my concern/complaint and how it will be escalated‬
‭ In‬‭ order‬‭ for‬‭ concerns‬‭ or‬‭ complaints‬‭ relating‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ (including‬‭ students,‬‭ staﬀ,‬‭ incidents‬‭ or‬‭ events)‬‭ to‬
‭ be‬‭ heard‬‭ and‬‭ resolved‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ this‬‭ Policy,‬‭ they‬‭ must‬‭ be‬‭ addressed‬‭ and,‬‭ if‬‭ necessary,‬‭ escalated‬‭ as‬
‭ follows:‬
−
‬‭ All‬‭ concerns‬‭ (including‬‭ concerns‬‭ regarding‬‭ student‬‭ achievement,‬‭ student‬‭ management‬‭ or‬‭ classroom‬
‭ matters)‬‭ should,‬‭ in‬‭ the‬‭ first‬‭ instance,‬‭ be‬‭ raised‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member‬‭ (e.g.‬‭ classroom‬
‭ teacher), a Divisional Dean or Counsellor (see‬‭ https://www.burnside.school.nz/people/‬‭ for details);‬
−
‬‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ concern‬‭ is‬‭ about‬‭ a‬‭ particular‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member,‬‭ contact‬‭ that‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member's‬‭ Head‬‭ of‬‭ Faculty‬‭ (see‬
‭ https://www.burnside.school.nz/people/‬‭ for details);‬
−
‬‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ concern‬‭ does‬‭ not‬‭ involve‬‭ a‬‭ classroom‬‭ matter‬‭ or‬‭ has‬‭ not‬‭ been‬‭ resolved‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ staﬀ‬
‭ member,‬‭ Dean‬‭ or‬‭ Counsellor,‬‭ contact‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ Divisional‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬‭ the‬‭ Associate‬‭ Principal‬‭ (see‬
‭ https://www.burnside.school.nz/people/‬‭ for details);‬
−
‬‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ concern‬‭ has‬‭ not‬‭ been‬‭ resolved‬‭ by‬‭ senior‬‭ management‬‭ or‬‭ is‬‭ otherwise‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ serious‬‭ nature,‬‭ it‬
‭ becomes a "complaint" and should be addressed in writing to the Principal;‬
‭
‭
‭
‭−
‭
‬
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ involves‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ (or‬‭ any‬‭ Board‬‭ member),‬‭ it‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ addressed‬
‭ to the Presiding Member (Chair) of the Board.‬
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ concern‬‭ or‬‭ complaint‬‭ has‬‭ not‬‭ been‬‭ resolved‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ complainant’s‬‭ satisfaction‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ Board,‬‭ the‬
‭ complainant‬‭ may‬‭ wish‬‭ to‬‭ further‬‭ escalate‬‭ the‬‭ matter‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ Ministry‬‭ of‬‭ Education,‬‭ the‬‭ Oﬃce‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ Ombudsman or, in respect of a teacher, the Teaching Council.‬
‭ Complaints‬‭ are‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ made‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ or‬‭ in‬‭ person.‬‭ If‬‭ made‬‭ in‬‭ person,‬‭ a‬‭ written‬‭ record‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ taken‬‭ of‬
‭ the complaint.‬
‭ Except‬‭ in‬‭ exceptional‬‭ circumstances,‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ will‬‭ not‬‭ accept‬‭ any‬‭ complaint‬‭ unless‬‭ the‬‭ correct‬‭ process‬
‭ (above)‬‭ has‬‭ been‬‭ followed‬‭ and,‬‭ if‬‭ not,‬‭ may‬‭ direct‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ back‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ relevant‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member‬‭ or‬‭ the‬
‭ Principal.‬
‭ See the attached flow-chart (Appendix 1) for a quick reference on where to address complaints.‬
‭ Process for dealing with concerns and complaints‬
▪
‭ Concerns‬‭ and‬‭ complaints‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ dealt‬‭ with‬‭ in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ this‬‭ Policy.‬‭ Initial‬‭ investigations‬‭ will‬
‭ be‬‭ carried‬‭ out‬‭ to‬‭ determine‬‭ the‬‭ seriousness‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ matter,‬‭ whether‬‭ it‬‭ can‬‭ be‬‭ resolved‬‭ informally‬‭ or‬
‭ whether a further, formal investigation and/or escalation is required.‬
▪
‭ Other‬‭ parties‬‭ (i.e.‬‭ class‬‭ teacher,‬‭ management;‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ (chair)‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Board),‬‭ are‬‭ informed‬
‭ at the Principal’s discretion and appropriate action taken at that point as required.‬
▪
‬‭ The‬‭ person(s)‬‭ raising‬‭ a‬‭ concern‬‭ or‬‭ complaint‬‭ may‬‭ wish‬‭ to‬‭ bring‬‭ a‬‭ support‬‭ person‬‭ along‬‭ with‬‭ them‬‭ to‬
‭ meetings with School staﬀ to discuss the matter.‬
▪
‬‭ Receipt‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ acknowledged‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ complainant‬‭ as‬‭ soon‬‭ as‬‭ possible.‬
‭ The complainant should also be advised of the process that will be followed and the outcomes.‬
▪
‭ For‬‭ some‬‭ concerns‬‭ or‬‭ complaints,‬‭ outside‬‭ mediation‬‭ may‬‭ be‬‭ sought‬‭ from‬‭ organisations‬‭ such‬‭ as‬
‭ School Trustees Association, PPTA, etc.‬
▪
‬‭ Complaints‬‭ to‬‭ or‬‭ escalated‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ addressed‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ Presiding‬‭ Member.‬‭ However,‬
‭ complaint correspondence addressed to the Presiding Member is for the whole Board.‬
▪
‭
‭ The‬‭ School’s‬‭ insurer‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ advised‬‭ of‬‭ any‬‭ complaint‬‭ escalated‬‭ to‬‭ or‬‭ received‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ as‬
‭ soon as possible.‬
‭
‬
‭
‬
‭
‭
‭
‬
‭
‬
‭ In dealing with all complaints, Burnside High School will act in accordance with conditions of‬
‭ any relevant employment contract(s), applicable laws and follow the principles of natural‬
‭ justice – which means acting fairly in the circumstances (including by giving a person‬
‭ adequate notice of a situation that may aﬀect them, giving a person an opportunity to be‬
‭ heard and respond, and ensuring that a decision will be made by an unbiased decision‬
‭ maker).‬

‭
‭
‬
‭
‭
‭ Complaints about students‬
▪
‭ All‬‭ complaints‬‭ (which‬‭ should‬‭ preferably‬‭ be‬‭ made‬‭ in‬‭ writing)‬‭ must‬‭ outline‬‭ clearly‬‭ the‬‭ details‬‭ of‬‭ the‬
‭ complaint‬‭ being‬‭ made‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ names‬‭ of‬‭ person/s‬‭ involved.‬‭ Where‬‭ a‬‭ complaint‬‭ is‬‭ not‬‭ initially‬‭ made‬

▪
‬‭ The‬‭ Principal‬‭ (or‬‭ other‬‭ senior‬‭ leadership‬‭ team‬‭ member‬‭ delegated‬‭ accordingly‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ Principal)‬‭ shall‬
‭ investigate‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ to‬‭ determine‬‭ whether‬‭ or‬‭ not‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ of‬‭ substance.‬‭ If‬‭ there‬‭ is‬‭ no‬‭ foundation‬
‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ or‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ capable‬‭ of‬‭ being‬‭ remedied‬‭ informally‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ agreement‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ parties‬
‭ concerned,‬‭ then‬‭ this‬‭ shall‬‭ conclude‬‭ the‬‭ inquiry‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ outcome‬‭ shall‬‭ be‬‭ advised‬‭ to‬‭ those‬
‭ concerned.‬
▪
‬‭ A written record shall be kept of the complaint and its resolution.‬
▪
‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ is‬‭ not‬‭ capable‬‭ of‬‭ being‬‭ resolved‬‭ informally‬‭ then‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ shall‬‭ give‬

‬
‭
‭
‭
‬
‭ Complaints about staﬀ‬
▪
‭ Complaints‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ in‬‭ writing,‬‭ clearly‬‭ setting‬‭ out‬‭ the‬‭ details‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ and‬‭ identifying‬‭ the‬
‭ person/s‬‭ involved.‬‭ It‬‭ is‬‭ acknowledged‬‭ in‬‭ some‬‭ cases‬‭ a‬‭ written‬‭ complaint‬‭ may‬‭ not‬‭ be‬‭ practicable,‬
‭ but a written record of the complaint will be made‬
▪
‬‭ If‬‭ a‬‭ complaint‬‭ is‬‭ received‬‭ about‬‭ a‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member’s‬‭ conduct‬‭ then‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ shall‬‭ instigate‬‭ an‬

‭ Principal.‬‭ If‬‭ the‬‭ complaint‬‭ is‬‭ about‬‭ or‬‭ concerned‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ Principal,‬‭ the‬‭ School‬‭ Board‬‭ shall‬‭ carry‬‭ out‬
‭ the‬‭ investigation.‬‭ The‬‭ purpose‬‭ of‬‭ this‬‭ initial‬‭ inquiry‬‭ is‬‭ to‬‭ determine‬‭ whether‬‭ there‬‭ is‬‭ any‬‭ foundation‬
‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ complaint,‬‭ whether‬‭ it‬‭ can‬‭ be‬‭ resolved‬‭ informally‬‭ or‬‭ if‬‭ it‬‭ should‬‭ be‬‭ the‬‭ subject‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ formal‬
‭ disciplinary investigation.‬
▪
‭ The‬‭ complaints‬‭ procedure,‬‭ including‬‭ any‬‭ investigation‬‭ into‬‭ a‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ complaint,‬‭ shall‬‭ comply‬‭ with‬‭ the‬

‭ What is a protected disclosure?‬
▪
‬‭ A‬‭ protected‬‭ disclosure‬‭ is‬‭ a‬‭ disclosure‬‭ of‬‭ information‬‭ made‬‭ by‬‭ an‬‭ employee‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ or‬
‭ Presiding‬‭ Member‬‭ (chair)‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ where‬‭ they‬‭ believe‬‭ serious‬‭ wrongdoing‬‭ has‬‭ occurred‬‭ and‬
‭ where‬‭ they‬‭ wish‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ protected‬‭ (in‬‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ Protected‬‭ Disclosures‬‭ Act‬‭ 2000)‬‭ against‬‭ a‬
‭ personal‬‭ grievance‬‭ or‬‭ other‬‭ retaliatory‬‭ or‬‭ disciplinary‬‭ action‬‭ (including‬‭ discrimination‬‭ or‬‭ legal‬
‭ proceedings) as a result of the disclosure and have their identity kept confidential.‬
▪
‬‭ Definition‬‭ of‬‭ serious‬‭ wrongdoing:‬‭ serious‬‭ wrongdoing‬‭ for‬‭ the‬‭ purposes‬‭ of‬‭ this‬‭ policy‬‭ includes‬‭ any‬‭ of‬
‭ the following in or by the School:‬
−
‬‭ Unlawful, corrupt, or irregular use of public funds or resources‬
−
‬‭ An act or omission or course of conduct:‬
‭ o‬‭ which seriously risks public health or safety or the environment; or‬
‭ o‬‭ that constitutes an oﬀence; or‬
‭ o‬
‭ that‬‭ is‬‭ oppressive,‬‭ improperly‬‭ discriminatory,‬‭ grossly‬‭ negligent‬‭ or‬‭ constitutes‬‭ gross‬
‭ mismanagement; or‬

‭ investigation, and detection of oﬀences and the right to a fair trial.‬
▪
‭ Not‬‭ all‬‭ complaints‬‭ by‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ are‬‭ protected‬‭ disclosures.‬‭ A‬‭ complaint‬‭ which‬‭ does‬‭ not‬‭ involve‬‭ serious‬
‭ wrongdoing‬‭ or‬‭ where‬‭ the‬‭ staﬀ‬‭ member‬‭ does‬‭ not‬‭ seek‬‭ the‬‭ formal‬‭ protections‬‭ against‬‭ retaliatory‬‭ or‬
‭ disciplinary‬‭ action‬‭ or‬‭ does‬‭ not‬‭ require‬‭ their‬‭ identity‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ kept‬‭ confidential‬‭ can‬‭ be‬‭ made‬‭ to‬‭ the‬
‭ Principal in accordance with this Policy.‬

−
‬‭ the employee wishes the disclosure to be protected.‬

‭ in this policy:‬
−
‬‭ may bring a personal grievance in respect of retaliatory action from their employers;‬

‭ having made or referred to a disclosure;‬
−
‬‭ will, subject to paragraph 3.9 of this Policy, have their identity kept confidential.‬
▪
‭
‬‭ The‬‭ protections‬‭ provided‬‭ in‬‭ this‬‭ section‬‭ will‬‭ not‬‭ be‬‭ available‬‭ to‬‭ employees‬‭ making‬‭ allegations‬‭ they‬
‭ know to be false or where they have acted in bad faith.‬
‭ How to submit a disclosure‬
‭ Any‬‭ employee‬‭ of‬‭ Burnside‬‭ High‬‭ School‬‭ who‬‭ wishes‬‭ to‬‭ make‬‭ a‬‭ protected‬‭ disclosure‬‭ should‬‭ do‬‭ so‬‭ In‬‭ writing‬‭ in‬
‭ accordance‬‭ with‬‭ this‬‭ Policy,‬‭ making‬‭ clear‬‭ that‬‭ they‬‭ believe‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ conditions‬‭ for‬‭ making‬‭ a‬‭ protected‬
‭ disclosure set out above have been met.‬
‭ Information to be contained‬
‭ The disclosure should contain detailed information including the following:‬
−
‭
‬‭ the nature of the serious wrongdoing‬
−
‬‭ the name or names of the people involved‬
−
‭
‬‭ surrounding‬‭ facts,‬‭ including‬‭ details‬‭ relating‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ time‬‭ and/or‬‭ place‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ wrongdoing‬‭ (if‬‭ known‬‭ or‬

‭
‭ Where to send disclosures‬
‭ A‬‭ disclosure‬‭ must‬‭ be‬‭ sent‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ who‬‭ has‬‭ been‬‭ nominated‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ Board‬‭ of‬‭ Burnside‬‭ High‬
‭ School under the provision of Section 11 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2000 for this purpose.‬
‭ or‬
‭ If‬‭ you‬‭ believe‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ is‬‭ involved‬‭ in‬‭ the‬‭ wrongdoing‬‭ or‬‭ has‬‭ an‬‭ association‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ person‬
‭ committing‬‭ the‬‭ wrongdoing‬‭ that‬‭ would‬‭ make‬‭ it‬‭ inappropriate‬‭ to‬‭ disclose‬‭ to‬‭ them,‬‭ then‬‭ you‬‭ can‬‭ make‬‭ the‬
‭ disclosure to the Presiding Member of the Board.‬
‭ Decision to investigate‬
‭ On‬‭ receipt‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ disclosure,‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ must‬‭ within‬‭ 20‬‭ working‬‭ days‬‭ examine‬‭ seriously‬‭ the‬‭ allegations‬‭ of‬
‭ wrongdoing‬‭ made‬‭ and‬‭ decide‬‭ whether‬‭ a‬‭ full‬‭ investigation‬‭ is‬‭ warranted.‬‭ If‬‭ warranted‬‭ a‬‭ full‬‭ investigation‬‭ will‬
‭ be‬‭ undertaken‬‭ or‬‭ arranged‬‭ by‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ as‬‭ quickly‬‭ as‬‭ practically‬‭ possible,‬‭ through‬‭ an‬‭ appropriate‬
‭ authority.‬
‭ Protection of disclosing employee's identity‬
‭ All‬‭ disclosures‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ treated‬‭ with‬‭ the‬‭ utmost‬‭ confidence.‬‭ When‬‭ undertaking‬‭ an‬‭ investigation,‬‭ and‬‭ when‬
‭ writing‬‭ the‬‭ report,‬‭ the‬‭ Principal‬‭ will‬‭ make‬‭ every‬‭ endeavour‬‭ not‬‭ to‬‭ reveal‬‭ information‬‭ that‬‭ can‬‭ identify‬‭ the‬
‭ disclosing‬‭ person,‬‭ unless‬‭ the‬‭ person‬‭ consents‬‭ in‬‭ writing‬‭ or‬‭ if‬‭ the‬‭ person‬‭ receiving‬‭ the‬‭ protected‬‭ disclosure‬
‭ reasonably believes that disclosure of identifying information is essential:‬
−
‭
‬‭ to ensure an eﬀective investigation‬
